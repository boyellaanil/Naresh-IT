we can even include one list inside the another list is called nested list
ex:
 <ol>
        <li>I love Three Books:
            <ul>
                <li>Harry Potter</li>
                <li>Lord of the Rings</li>
                <li>Game of Thrones</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I love three movies:
            <ul>
                <li>Jabillamma niku antha kopama</li>
                <li>12th Fail</li>
                <li>RRR</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>i love these technologies
            <ul>
                <li>JAVA</li>
                <li>PYTHON</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

TABLES:
tables are used to represent the data in rows and cols.Horizantal ones
are called rows and vertical ones are called columns

whole table is inside the 'table'element

each row of the table is in 'tr'element(table row)

the data inside each row might be 'th' (table heading)or 'td'(table data)

the border of the table can be defined by 'border' attribute

all 'th' elements are bold and centered

to cmbine the rows ,we can use rowspan attribute and 
to combine columns we can use colspan attribute

ex:
<table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>sno</th>
            <th>subject</th>
            <th>marks</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>tel</td>
            <td>90</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>eng</td>
            <td>95</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>maths</td>
            <td>100</td>
        </tr>    
    </table>

    <!-- table with colspan and rowspan -->
    <table border="2">
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>raj</td>
            <td rowspan="2">25</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>shekar</td>
          
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="3">table ending</td>
        </tr>
    </table>




container elements
non container elements

1.container elements: 
    these elements are used to combine or wrap the multiple
    other elements as one element such that its designing is easy
ex:
<h2>
  <p>Hello</p>
  <a href=">world</a>
</h2>


we can use general elements of containers are div and span

2.non container elements:
    these elements are used not to wrap the other elements because they don't have closing tags
ex:
img,br,hr,....etc


what is the difference between div and span?

based on presentation of elements ,container elments as divided as 2 types
  a.block elements
     these elements are used to wrap multiple elements as single element and present them in new line.
     they don't allow any other element beside them.
    ex:
    headings, p, lists
     common block element is 'div'

  b.inline elements
     these elements are used to wrap multiple elements as one element and present them in same line.
     they allow other elements beside them.
     ex:
      img,a,formatting-tags

normally inline elements cannot have height and width but img tag is an exception

ex:
<h1>where heart meets <span>art.</span></h1>

Semantic elements:
==================
these elements are used as a alternative to div and span but they provide easily understandable code.
for user it won't show any differnce but search engine refers them as their own purposes
ex:
header,footer,main,aside,article, section,nav,figure

header - it is used to denote the header of the website
footer - it is used to denote the footer of the website
main - it is used to denote the main section of the website
article - it is used to show the articles such as posts,ecommerce blog ...etc
section - it is used to show the specific section of the website
nav - it is the only inline element to store  pages links
figure - it is used to combine images with its caption
